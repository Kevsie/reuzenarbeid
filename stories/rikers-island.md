# Rikers Island

The facility reclaims over (number) square feet to fit the current penitentiary, a modern iteration of the heyday at Blackwell’s Island. The name Rikers goes back to Dutch colonial times when the current mayor Peter Stuyvesant granted the land to a family of farmers. The island sustained at least one household throughout its life as a colonial land appropriated from the native people of Manhattan, and was associated with Queens county until the city consolidated and is now under Bronx jurisdiction. Landfill was redirected to Rikers which ended New York’s ocean dumping that harmed Coney Island and New Jersey shores as well as construction debris from the city’s excavation of subway lines. Much of the labor was carried out by prisoners of Rikers Island in 1935 which at this time had preliminary prison facilities.
