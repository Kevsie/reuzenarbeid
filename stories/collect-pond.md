# Collect Pond

The bay originally emptied the natural stream coming from todayâ€™s Central Park Pond (located at the 59th Street and 5th Avenue entrance) into the East River. The United Nations headquarters in New York City today migrated to the former bay in the mid-20th century from its temporary convention center at Flushing Bay in Queens, which now is the building of the Queens Museum. By this time, the idyllic scene and natural resources at the bay were already razed and construction was underway to transform five industrial blocks of the city into the Headquarters. Le Corbusier along with Oscar Niemeyer, the leading advisors to the group of architects in the project, influenced for the complex to reflect the International Style of architecture. Today, the site is considered to be under jurisdiction of international grounds and stands very out of the way in its midtown context; water access is severed from the complex by the expressway and the buildings are erected in a slight depression within the landscape.
