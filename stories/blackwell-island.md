# Blackwell Island

Roosevelt Island, originally land of the Lenape and then turned farmland by the Dutch, has been through a (excommunication) history that (contrasts) its suburban disposition within the context of the city. One of the only island communities outside of the massive Manhattan island, Roosevelt Island claims a shoreline all to itself, but it has not always been defined by scenic views and jogging couples. Insane asylums, hospitals, and penitentiaries dominated the landscape of the island during the time that Manhattan was expanding by the Commissionerâ€™s grid plan and the population of immigrants in downtown Manhattan was exponentially growing. The corrective institutions were wildly untamed, corrupted, and never functional as documented in the outstanding reports of young female journalist Nellie Bly. In the question of its future under 20th Century governance, Roosevelt Island became a hotbed for architectural revival and expanded city planning, including the preservation of some of the original institutional buildings and urban green-space renewal. Today, the ruins of Blackwell Island dilapidate peripherally to the growing information center started by Cornell Tech as well as the open landscapes on the island, including Four Freedoms park designed by architect Louis Kahn. The site is more accessible and favorable to visit today and can be reached by tram, subway, and ferry.
