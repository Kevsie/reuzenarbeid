# Spuyten Duyvil Creek

This creek, now the namesake of a shorefront park right across the Harlem River from Inwood Park, was a shallow and noxious waterway with four tides per day which at the time only suggested that Manhattan was detached from mainland Bronx. In Dutch, the Spuyten Duyvil translates as the 'Spitting Devil' so you can imagine the difficulty for the original settlers of the island to navigate their wide wooden ships to get from one side of the island to the other. The shoreline park is bounded by the Metro-North Rail which runs directly on the coast and makes its way into Grand Central from the station in 23 minutes.
