This waterfront park in the Bronx, originally destined as the Harlem River Park, houses a complex of recreational programs. The namesake of Roberto Clemente is dedicated to the first Latino-born baseball player in a New York professional league. The park welcomes people of all walks of life to engage with pool facilities, water playgrounds, baseball fields, basketball courts, and water related amenities. However, the park directors admit to the parkâ€™s low favorability to the waterfront. Hurricane Sandy inflicted some damage to the park in (year) and it is currently going through renovations to make the park more Harlem River friendly and improve on its other water related destinations.
