title: Cromwell’s Creek
---

Cromwell’s Creek, completely filled in by modern infrastructure, used to flow south into the Harlem River from the inside of the Bronx. At the confluence, tidal marshland areas transitioned the entry point of the Bronx into the Harlem river from a more terrestrial and hilly environment to that of the marshy ecosystem in early New York history. The Creek is completely filled in today, with major parkland occupying the space where water used to flow. Gradually the area was filled in for new development in the 18th century. The largest baseball stadium, home to the Yankees, sits on the forgotten Creek and is neighbor to Heritage Field where the first stadium was built in 1923.  The migration of urban programs and their remnant footprints contrasts sharply with depletion of environmental ecosystems native to the site and potentially nascent for the site. What other life forms can exist within environments that are constantly replacing each other?
