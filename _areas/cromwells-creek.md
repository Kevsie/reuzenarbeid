---
Cromwell’s Creek, completely filled in by modern infrastructure, used to flow south from Morris Heights in the inside of the Bronx into the Harlem River.  At the confluence, tidal marshes marked the transition area between the Bronx and the Harlem River from a more terrestrial and hilly environment to that of the marshy wetland ecosystem in early New York history. The Creek is completely filled in today, with major parkland occupying the space where water used to flow. Gradually the waterbody was filled in for new development starting in the 1700s. Macombs Dam Bridge symbolically extends the flow of the now deceased creek and connects Manhattan to the Bronx at a very busy intersection which involves pedestrians, baseball spectators, vehicles, bicyclists, and residential blocks all coming together at once.

The largest baseball stadium, home to the Yankees, [sits on the forgotten creek](https://hiddenwatersblog.wordpress.com/2016/02/18/cromwells-creek-at-yankee-stadium/) and is neighbor to Heritage Field where the first stadium was built in 1923. The migration of urban programs and their remnant footprints contrasts sharply with depletion of environmental ecosystems native to the site. One of the forgotten attractions that once linked the environment and recreation in harmony includes ice skating at Mill Pond. Filled in since the beginning of the 20th century, the pond was a bonus to the larger hydrological system sustained by the bloodline of Cromwell’s Creek and successfully organized communities around water.
