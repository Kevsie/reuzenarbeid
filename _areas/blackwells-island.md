The City of New York excommunicates Roosevelt Island, originally land of the Lenape then turned farmland at the hands of the Dutch, for most of its history which seems contradictory to its comfortable suburban disposition within the context of the city. One of the only island communities outside of the massive Manhattan island, Roosevelt Island claims a shoreline all to itself, but it has not always been defined by scenic views and jogging couples. Insane asylums, hospitals, and penitentiaries dominated the landscape of the island during the time that Manhattan was expanding by the Commissioner’s Plan of 1811 and the population of immigrants in downtown Manhattan was exponentially growing. The corrective institutions were wildly untame, corrupted, and never functional as documented in the outstanding reports of young female journalist Nellie Bly. At one of the heights of its instability, Riverside Hospital needed to be moved to North Brother Island where it received the transferred patients from Blackwells Island.

In the question of its future under 20th Century governance, Roosevelt Island became a hotbed for architectural revival and expanded city planning, including the preservation of some of the original institutional buildings and urban green-space renewal. Today, the ruins of Blackwells Island dilapidate peripherally to the growing information center started by Cornell Tech as well as the open landscapes on the island, including Four Freedoms park designed by architect Louis Kahn. The site is more accessible and favorable to visit today and can be reached by tram, subway, and ferry.
