title: Randall’s and Ward’s Island
---
Similar to Roosevelt Island and North Brother Island, the city’s outcasts were quarantined outside of bustling lower Manhattan into remote concentrations of marginalized people on islands like Randall’s and Ward’s, often left unattended by the state and city during the 19th century. The overwhelming influx of immigrants and massive construction initiatives taken up by the city during this time made Randall’s and Ward’s Islands a designation for controlling populations and (supporting) unaccounted (episodes) of neglect. Before the horrific maltreatment of New York City’s outcasts in the 19th century, Randall’s and Ward’s Islands were known as Little Barn and Big Barn islands, a misnomer of the British man who bought the property to (start) industry. The islands were separated from each other by a Sunken Meadow as well as from the greater Manhattan, which was still in the year (what year) mostly farmland and wild terrain. Instituting massive change to the city fabric in the early 20th Century, Robert Moses, head of the Triborough Bridge Authority at the time, pushes negotiations to shut down the unjust hospitals and asylums and build a massive bridge project that links Manhattan, the Bronx, and Queens today. The site, historically a receptacle for unwanted people and occupations, reflects a tumultuous past and is itself fragmented in program, oddly partitioned to accommodate city operations closed off to the public and open space for public use. Although envisioned as a revitalized space for the community around the island, Randall’s and Ward’s is still out of reach in the city imaginary as the traffic to and from boroughs dominates provisional public access via footpaths and minimal bike lanes.
