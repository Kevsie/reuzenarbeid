Under the green lawns and ball parks of McCarren Park in Greenpoint today lies the remains of sediment from which originated waterways flowing out of Brooklyn and into the East River years ago. In 1645 when the first settlers arrived and acquired the land from the Lenape, two streams could be found as crossroads in a landscape long removed by modern society. They converge at a local salt marsh exactly located at the site of McCarren Park today, which provided diverse ecological functions to the surrounding Brooklyn area and regulated the land's natural hydrology. Bushwick Creek, in Dutch known as Boswijck or 'little town in the woods', was part of a larger shoreline condition that defined much of north Brooklyn's egde at the East River and connected farmland production to markets in Manhattan.

As industrialization replaced many farmlands in Brooklyn, the waters were covered to provide as much usable land for new industry toward the middle of the 19th century. McCarren Park, commissioned in 1909, posted a strategic urban intervention of green space for northern Brooklyn which countered the highly industrialized neighborhood dominated by Astral Oil Works factories. Today, the areaâ€™s waterfront is a highly contested ground for stakeholders in land development. Rezoning in the city caused land values along the shore to increase. With luxury residential developments arising along the coast, it is crucial that the waterfront be open and accessible to all residents of the neighborhood. The Bushwick Inlet Park proposes to consolidate this edge and provide a naturalistic appearance of the shoreline including beaches and wetlands among its public programming spaces like a kayak launch. The last piece of waterfront was purchased by the city after heated negotiations of land purchasing which caused some delay in connecting and making accessible the north Brooklyn waterfront. Hopefully soon the fences guarding the space will be removed and the shoreline once again can be connected to the mainland in a meaningful and healthy way under the Bushwick Inlet Park plans.
