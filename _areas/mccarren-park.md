# McCarren Park

Bushwick Inlet used to be a waterway that would travel deep into Brooklyn, also known as Breukelen for the first Dutch settlers. As industrialization replaced many farmlands in Brooklyn, the waters were covered to provide as much usable land for new industry. The park, commissioned by senator Patrick McCarrin, posted a strategic urban intervention of green space for northern Brooklyn. Today, the area’s waterfront is a highly contested ground for stakeholders of land development. The last piece of waterfront was purchased by the city and plans to construct a natural park are underway. An alternate to the city’s planning initiatives brings to focus the existing infrastructures of the site and transforms the objects to drive the programmatic elements to the park. How does this forgotten stream today shape the way the city’s inhabitants view the city? Or in what ways does the removal and implementation of new land use manifest itself in the city today.
