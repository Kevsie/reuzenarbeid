title: Governor’s Island
---
Governor’s Island was actually the first stop for many of the first Dutch settlers in the New World. They tried to cultivate farmland, sawmills, and cattle although the conditions were insufficient to continue these practices on the island. One can imagine the timidity many of the settlers would have had to experience when facing the 1609 shoreline of the larger, more important island to the north. As the population increased on the little island, called Nooten Eylandt (Nutten Island) by the Dutch who went by the Lenape’s classification of the island, people slowly made the jump to Lower Manhattan via rowboats transporting their cattle and crops along with them. The shoreline of Lower Manhattan just beyond the original 70 acre island was an ideal location for many ships to dock as the waters reach depths enough for larger vessels to comfortably sit at the harbor. As Lower Manhattan shoreline’s grew, they took up more water area, thus changing the natural shoreline depth, often dramatizing depth for more and more ships to dock. Nutten Island remained an idyllic retreat for the Dutch settler’s governors as well as the future British commanders.
