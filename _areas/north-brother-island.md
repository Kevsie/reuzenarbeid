---
In 1695, colonial settlers stumble upon two companion islands in the East River comfortably nested between the southern Bronx coast and northern Queens limits. North Brother Island and definitely smaller South Brother Island remain relatively dormant under the ownership of the new residents who focus thier attention in developing the more busy areas of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Strong currents around the islands and the detached position from the emerging city diffuse the settlers's initial interest with colonizing the site, although the networks for future expansion have already been established. In two hundred years, North Brother Island is activated as the city grows and requires more space to accomodate space for hospitals, public gardens, and finally an asylum for young drug addicts. Transferred from Blackwell's Island in 1885, Riverside Hospital quarantines typhoid patients away from the city mass and engages in the city's tradition of employing island land masses to detain unwanted immigrants and sick people. This first hospital sets the precedent for the island's consequent regenerations as a place to store the city's castaways, usually due to a lack of management of the population boom and immigrantion spike as well as the medical knowledge for taking care of patients with infectious diseases.

In the 1950s, when the city reclaims the island, Riverside Hospital accomodates a growing population of young people affected by a narcotics epidemic in New York City. Frank Lima, New York City poet born in Spanish Harlem, was a former patient in the rehabilitation program there and notes that the island "was one hell of an experience. We made up the laws and rules. It was a pathological zoo." In the midst of all this chaos, Lima is encouraged to continue his poetry by fellow artist and mentor Sherman Drexler who would teach painting to the youth in the facility. Both figures are indicative of the larger art scene in New York City at the time and more peripherally the drug addictions that became popular within their circles and more widespread throughout the city. The island also reappears in a number of fictional literature works including Tennessee Williams's 'Moise and the World of Reason' and Evan Hunter's short story "Happy New Year, Herbie." The institution is abandonned in the 1960s. Today, the site is in architectural ruin, Riverside Hospital decaying and hollow, and only authorized personnel has access to the island. There also has been a recent decline in the number of wading birds spotted on the island, indicating an ecological shift in the New York City demography of birds.
