In geological terms, a bluff is an elevated territory of land that has been eroded by coastal conditions such as sea spray and wind to form a rounded cliff, which is also called a promontory. (what is today’s elevation of the site?) (What is the Polo Grounds Stadium?) The sport stadium which migrated just across the water to make room for the Polo Ground Houses in 1950.
