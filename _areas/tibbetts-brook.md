Today, this part of Tibbett’s Brook flows under city street as it was channeled underground in the late (date). The Brook resurfaces in Van Cortlandt Park and enters Van Cortlandt Lake. The lake was formed in 1699 when the Van Cortlandt estate built a dam to provide power for their sawmill, a popular form of economic growth in the 18th century. The Park and lake today are the only remnants of native New York forestry that could have been found in the pre colonial era. Projects to daylight, or expose the water to the aboveground, the Brook provide interesting prospects to connect city parks together and relieve the city sewer system of CSOs (Combined Sewage Overflow) during storms.
