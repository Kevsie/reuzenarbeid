title: Stryker's Bay
---
In New York City’s early colonial past, the Upper West Side of Manhattan rendered a wealthy suburban setting with small hamlets sprinkled conveniently along the island’s coastline. Stryker’s Bay was one of these settlements and centered itself around a small inlet that has since been filled in. Spanning the length of one subway stop on the 1 train, the sleepy town was comfortably situated between present day 86th Street and 96th Street along Bloomingdale Road, or today’s Broadway. The bay had an intimate waterfront public life and hosted joyful small town affairs at the Stryker’s Bay Tavern. A ferry transported people from Stryker’s manicured farmlands and picket-fences along the Hudson River to a bustling downtown area teeming with new businesses and modern city developments. The majority of these West Side towns took advantage of the undisturbed natural topography of Manhattan, although many, like Harsenville, Carmansville, and Manhattanville, used it to their advantage, either exploiting land for industrial use, farmland, or institutional landmarking.
