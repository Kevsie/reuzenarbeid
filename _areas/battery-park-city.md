Envisioned as a residential area for professionals working in the Financial District, Battery Park City sits on an artificial appendage of New York City and hosts mostly family dwellers who can afford the expensive high rise apartments there. Since the 1960s when the plans to build the new addition to the city emerge, many of the public space amenities Battery Park City projected at first were slowly taken up by buildings to house new residents. Located on the outside of the West Side Highway, Battery Park City includes various amenities like _ and _ to its residents as well as specific destinations to attract the city, like NYC's specialized public school Stuyvesant High School and the green spaces dispersed within the perimiter. The site was speculated in attempts to transform the dilapidating warehouses and piers that have before serviced the -.  

Realizing the new urban imaginary went through various installation periods that adjusted original plans as well as the relation of the materiality of the construction site to the surrounding community. From the beginning, the project encounters New York in a fiscally stagnant time and was determined to vitalize the Financial District. Proposals to hit the ground running in turn proved flat for some time. Debris and soil excavated from the World Trade Center construction phase composes Battery Park City's foundation as well as rubbish landfill that collected over time when the plans to move forward with building plans stalled. Consequently, artists and artist collectives interevened at the landfill site, one such being Creative Time's inaugural "Art on the Beach" that featured site specific installations by artists or Agnes Dennis's "Wheatfield -- A Confrontation" supported by the Public Art Fund which has produced stunning documentation of a gold wheatfield in downtown New York. The project actually cultivated wheat, successfully juxtaposing the rural environment that visually identifies with the non-urban but makes the _ relationship more present and concrete in this new setting.
