Tubby Hook was once an awesome natural feature of the Manhattan coastline and the rural charm of Manhattanville was enhanced by the grandeur of the Hudson and the Palisades just across the river in New Jersey. A subject of many artistic expressions, particularly in the Hudson River School of painting, Tubby Hook, along with Fort Tryon Park and the surrounding area, including the Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb which is situated on present day Columbia University campus, was rendered as one of the last untouched habitats of the island before the grid influenced their divisions. Published in _Scribner’s_ magazine in 1893, American novelist HC Bunner’s piece “Tiemann’s to Tubby Hook” critiques the establishment of the gridiron in Manhattan and provides a nuanced glimpse into what it might have felt like to be living in such a transformative period in New York City history that would define its future existence. Bunner writes:

_The Bloomingdale Road, with its great arching willows, its hospitable old roadhouses withdrawn from the street and hidden far down shady lanes that led riverward — the splendid old highway retained something of its charm; but day by day the gridiron system of streets encroached upon it, and day by day the shanties and the cheap villas crowded in along its sides, between the old farmstead and the country-places. And then it led only to the raw and unfinished Central Park, and to the bare waste and dreary fag-end of a New York that still looked upon Union Square as an uptown quarter._

The experience Bunner arrives at romanticizes the natural qualities of the island in a time that is defined by technological advancement and the abstraction of land for city building. Although in the energy of logic and genius that the gridiron system proclaims during this time of New York City history, the tensions between the physicality of the island and human endeavor and experience sharpen in disparity. Bunner continues in his personal account:

_But if the beauty of Broadway as a country high-road had been marred by its adaptation to the exigencies of a suburb of moderate means, […] to right and to left, as we wandered northward, five minutes’ walk would take us into a country of green lanes and meadows and marshland and woodland; where houses and streets were as yet too few to frighten away that kindly old Dame Nature who was always so glad to see us._

Boyhood descriptions aside, the scene Bunner describes is almost unrecognizable in the city today. The vastness of territory in Bunner’s perspective shears his expectations of what Central Park will become in his lifetime, a vast oasis which can be read as the negative space of a sytstem that has taken over the rural settings Bunner is describing. More specifically Bunner references Tubby Hook and its unique position on the Hudson River as his favorite place in Manhattanville to 'ramble' in. Furthermore, he reflects on the continuation of the gridiron and condemns its despicable repercussions on the nature he so arduously pursues. The following is a sleight of criticism on modern city life, which has evolved into what we have today.

_Great, cheerless, hideously ornate flat buildings reared their zinc-tipped fronts toward the gray heaven, to show the highest aspirations of that demoralized suburb in the way of domestic architecture. To right, to left, every way I turned, I saw cheap, tawdry, slipshod imitation of the real city — or perhaps I should say, of all that is ugliest and vulgarest, least desirable, and least calculated to endure, in the troubled face of city life._

In the end, many of the early Westside hamlets relate to Bunner’s descriptions of a rural Manhattanville, which are slowly being taken over by development in the late 19th Century. The homogenous architecture described in the criticism is derivative of the repetitive grid system and paradoxically complicates the seeming order of the nature authors like Bunner like to allude to. However, the hamlets in themselves can be seen as the seeds of urbanization itself and it would be blinding to want to preserve the  idyllic quality of Nature when its bound to human intervention at any rate. The illusive Tubby Hook, a detail in the text but a great promontory of the physical coastline, grounds the experience and explains much of the author’s dissatisfaction of the destruction of the natural habitat when it is pummeled to the ground literally to provide for landfill and expansion material.

_Down there, on old Manhattan,_
_Where land-sharks breed and fatten,_
_They’ve wiped out Tubby Hook._
_That famous promontory,_
_Renowned in song and story,_
_Which time nor tempest shook,_
_Whose name for aye had been good,_
_Stands newly christened ‘Inwood’_
_And branded with the shame_
_Of some old rogue who passes_
_By dint of aliases,_
_Afraid of his own name!_

William Allen Butler, 1886
