Victor Gifford Audubon. View of Hudson River. c1843. Oil on canvas.

Tubby Hook was once an awesome natural feature of the Manhattan coastline and the rural charm of Manhattanville was enhanced by the grandeur of the Hudson and the Palisades just across the river in New Jersey. A subject of many artistic expressions, particularly in the Hudson River School of painting, Tubby Hook, along with Fort Tryon Park and the surrounding area, including the Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb which is situated on present day Columbia University campus, was rendered as one of the last untouched habitats of the island before the grid influenced their divisions. 

Many of the early Westside hamlets were slowly being taken over by development in the late 19th Century. The more romantic rural settings were decimated by the repetitive grid system which paradoxically complicated the seeming order of the nature present to descriptions of the natural landscape of early Manhattan. However, the hamlets in themselves can be seen as the seeds of urbanization itself and it would be blinding to want to preserve the idyllic quality of Nature when its bound to human intervention at any rate. The illusive Tubby Hook, a detail in the city's history but a great promontory of the physical coastline, grounds the experience of the destruction of the natural habitat when it is pummeled to the ground literally to provide for landfill and expansion material.

_Down there, on old Manhattan,_
_Where land-sharks breed and fatten,_
_They’ve wiped out Tubby Hook._
_That famous promontory,_
_Renowned in song and story,_
_Which time nor tempest shook,_
_Whose name for aye had been good,_
_Stands newly christened ‘Inwood’_
_And branded with the shame_
_Of some old rogue who passes_
_By dint of aliases,_
_Afraid of his own name!_

William Allen Butler, 1886
