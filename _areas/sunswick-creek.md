# Sunswick Creek

Like most lost native ecologies, the city turns neglected sites into park lands. Socrates Sculpture Park, located at the mouth of Sunswick Creek, resembles the community initiative inspired by artists Mark di Suvero along with (Noguchi) to restore the land for people to use. The park (park’s importance). From here, the creek moves South into Queens towards present day Long Island City, a path followed by artist Mary Miss in her 2012 installation ‘Reflecting Forward’. The Creek previously (why was the Creek important? sawmill?) and its physical fissure of the part of Queens reflects today’s mostly detached and fairly industrial atmosphere of the site. (What is there today?)
