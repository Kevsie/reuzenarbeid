Like most native ecologies lost to urbanization in the city, neglected sites potentially can be transformed into park lands. Sunswick Creek originally flowed through Queens from present day Astoria towards Long Island City, severing this part of Queens into a distinct and ecologically diverse land mass or salt marshes and rich soils. Following the line of creek, industry would soon root itself within the footprint dilineated by hydrology and pervert the land's innate logics and natural processes. Colonial sawmills were replaced by heavier industrial equipment which solidified the industrial atmosphere of the site. A major player in this setting was the Steinway Company town which emerged and took over most of the Astoria landscape.

Industry in Queensbridge at the beginning of the 20th century 

Socrates Sculpture Park, located at the mouth of Sunswick Creek, resembles the community initiative inspired by artists Mark di Suvero along with Isamu Noguchi to restore the land for people to use. The park successfully uses space that has been in recent history frequently overlooked and underappreciated by the city due to the coarseness of its appearance as an unregulated and illegal dumping ground. Located in a low income community in the late 20th century, the status of the site during its most vulnerable time corrupted the image of the area and encouraged the illegal activity further. The community, in response to multiple calls of action by local activists, mobilzed to export the dump to somewhere else in order to restore the environment. Today, the neighborhood is booming with new residents and makers completely recontextualizing where the origins of the creek have come from.
