# Newtown Creek

The creek diverges into two other streams closer to the terminal inland. Closer to the boundary between Brooklyn and Queens lies a cemetery belt separating the areas of Maspeth and Ridgewood from Bushwick. Newtown Creek is notoriously and historically polluted with many of the factories and individual rubbish throughout the years. The nature trail along Newtown Creek seeks to console the situation of the Creek with its pungent past.

[The Newtown Creek hosts boaters from around the neighborhood and leads water expeditions regularly](http://northbrooklynboatclub.org/about/)
