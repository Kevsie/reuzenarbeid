This charming and dynamic creek disappointingly has been corrupted by the city's industrial zone like no other. In its most healthy state years ago, the creek would stream water into the East River from two divergent creeks located closer to the terminal inland. At the boundary between Brooklyn and Queens lies a cemetery belt separating the areas of Maspeth and Ridgewood from Bushwick where wetlands previously existed. Newtown Creek is notoriously and historically polluted with many of the factories and individual rubbish, including full animal corpses, throughout the years. It literally became the city's trash septic. Controversial oil spills in recent decades has ruined the hydrology of the water up to such a critical point that millions of dollars in efforts, as well as the efforts of fervent activists in the neighborhood, has been spent to desperately replenish the Creek to some sort of functional state.

In the process of its restoration, the nature trail in Greenpoint along Newtown Creek seeks to console the situation of the Creek with its pungent past. The thin path outlines the periphery of the imposing wastewater treatment plant conducting a trail between the noxious creek water and plant's storage eggs. The 360 view at the site provides no relief; crushing automobiles swinging in the air from large combine machines just across the water along with heaps of tires and empty lots all hug the nature trail with no familial affection. The nature walk's attempt to attract the public to a healing waterfront is yet to be realized and someday may be activated to promote a larger scale intervention to consolidate all of Newtown Creek.
