The Harlem River Ship Canal, a massive vision that was bound to fulfill many ship-goers dreams, executed an awesome feat during the late 19th Century. The land mass of Marble Hill originally connected to the eastern most part of the northern tip of Manhattan, today where Columbia University Bakers Field is located and Broadway extends to the Bronx. The bulging appendage posed an obstacle for many maritime voyages as the Spuyten Duyvil Creek was already uncompromising enough. Finally with government support and a company’s work force, the Harlem River Ship Canal blasted through the crevice in 1895 that just barely joined Marble Hill with Manhattan and created a creek wide enough for ships to pass through from the Harlem River and onto the Hudson. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.nypl.org/index.php?id=804961&t=w\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Marble Hill's identity as an island was only temporary as it later joined the Bronx in 1913 by landfill of the original Spuyten Duyvil Creek using material from the excavation for the foundation for the Grand Central Terminal. The final phase to complete the vision for a passageway that would make the island fully possible to circumnavigate fused the peninsula that stuck out of the Bronx to Manhattan. The result forced Johnson Iron Works, a company town that produced steel mechanical parts on the peninsula and peaked in productivity and population around 1917, to shut down and the land was fused to supply Manhattan’s further expansion. The island was now fully independent as a land mass and a web of communication and transportation infrastructure progressively installed Manhattan’s site specificity. Marble Hill, now a part of the Bronx, is still technically part of Manhattan; its street names are a reminder of the founding Dutch colony that made its way as the first European settlement in the island and it is one of the only places in Manhattan, similar to the neighborhood of Spuyten Duyvil, where urban dwellers live in freestanding houses with porches and spacious gardens. Its winding roads reflect the former path the Spuyten Duyvil Creek established so long ago and is now imprinted into the city’s concrete fabric. </p>",

Since the 1980s when the plan to build the new addition to city emerged, many of the public space amenities Battery Park City projected at first were slowly taken up by buildings to house new residents. The project encountered New York in a fiscally stagnant time and determined to vitalize the Financial District. Proposals to hit the ground running in turn proved flat for some time. Consequently, artists and artist collectives interevened at the landfill site, one such being Creative Time's inaugural \"Art on the Beach\" that featured site specific installations by artists or Agnes Dennis's \"Wheatfield\" which has produced stunning documentation of a gold wheatfield with downtown New York as the background. </p>",

As industrialization replaced many farmlands in Brooklyn, the waters were covered to provide as much usable land for new industry. The park, commissioned by senator Patrick McCarrin, posted a strategic urban intervention of green space for northern Brooklyn. Today, the area’s waterfront is a highly contested ground for stakeholders of land development. The last piece of waterfront was purchased by the city and plans to construct a natural park are underway. An alternate to the city’s planning initiatives brings to focus the existing infrastructures of the site and transforms the objects to drive the programmatic elements to the park. How does this forgotten stream today shape the way the city’s inhabitants view the city? Or in what ways does the removal and implementation of new land use manifest itself in the city today.</p>\n<p>More about the project: http://www.maker-park.org</p>",
